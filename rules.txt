Mirroring Rules:
- Replace if statement with turnary operators
- Add empty tables
- Split an action to sub-actions, which are runned consecutively
- Extraneous Bit Flips
- Writing to registers, bit flip, and read back to register


One example bit flip we can do is :

unsigned int c = ((x & 0xaaaaaaaa) >> 1) | ((x & 0x55555555) << 1);
c = ((c & 0xaaaaaaaa) >> 1) | ((c & 0x55555555) << 1);

this is the equivalent of twice reversing a bit vector, which should be equivalent (I think - got it
