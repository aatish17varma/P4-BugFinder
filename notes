Control:
  - 'in', 'inout', and 'out' are specifications for parameters.
  - 'in' refers to an input and cannot be modified
  - 'out' refers to an output, which should be modified
  - 'inout' refers to a variable to that functions as both an input and out, which should be
  modified.


  Headers are encapsulated in each other....
    - There is a large "frame" which holds an IP header, and IP Data. 
    - The IP Data holds a TCP header and TCP data
    - The TCP data holds the Application Data. 

    This is why in the P4 parser, you parse the large ethernet header, and find the upper layer
    headers inside of that and parse those.
