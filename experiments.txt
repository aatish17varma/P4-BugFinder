What I have tried:
  - tried changing "size = 1024" to "size = 1024 + 1 - 1", compiled correctly. 
  - replaced "if (hdr.ipv4.isValid()) { " with  "if (hdr.ipv4.isValid() == true ? true : false) { ", compiled correctly.
  - added random integer local variable to an action - "int<10> y = 1; ", compiled correctly.
  
Interesting things that I have noticed:
  - added 'in error parseError' as a parameter to the ingress control, got "cannot unify parseError
  paraemeter with hdr because they have different directions" - weird (don't know what that means). 
  

4/1/19 - Looked at https://github.com/p4lang/p4c/issues?q=is%3Aissue+author%3Avikramnathan+is%3Aclosed, saw that most errors had
to do with registers and bit vectors. Will take a closer look. 

4/2/19 - tried to write struct within a struct in P4, could not compile
         documentation does not describe well what ks[] in the ParserModel is, ask @Anirudh or
         @Vikas

       - added two transition statements in the same state (transition accept; transition reject;),
         and compiler threw error - "unexpected TRANSITION, expecting }". Documenttion did not specify
         specifically that you couldn't have two transitions. ask @Anirudh or @Vikas

       
       - Added transition to start state in start state. Program compiled, but threw warning that
         Accept State was unreachable. Seems ok, but I think it would be better to not allow
         infinite loop like this.

        - changed TYPE_IPV4 to really long bit string, compiled complained correctly that cant do that
         shit
