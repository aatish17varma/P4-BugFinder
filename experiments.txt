What I have tried:
  - tried changing "size = 1024" to "size = 1024 + 1 - 1", compiled correctly. 
  - replaced "if (hdr.ipv4.isValid()) { " with  "if (hdr.ipv4.isValid() == true ? true : false) { ", compiled correctly.
  - added random integer local variable to an action - "int<10> y = 1; ", compiled correctly.
  
Interesting things that I have noticed:
  - added 'in error parseError' as a parameter to the ingress control, got "cannot unify parseError
  paraemeter with hdr because they have different directions" - weird (don't know what that means).

to do with registers and bit vectors. Will take a closer look. 

4/2/19 - tried to write struct within a struct in P4, could not compile
